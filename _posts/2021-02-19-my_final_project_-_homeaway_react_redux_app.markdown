Finally, I'm here. Working on my last project. It has been a long trip to this point. I know coding is a never-ending journey, but I'm exacted to mark this important milestone and start the next chapter of the journey.

The final project is the most comprehensive task so far for sure. I have utilized all the tools I got so far and more, and piece everything together. I want to pick something I'm interested in, and also provide the right dose of challenge that will help me grow the most from completing the challenge.

While there are all kinds of obstacles along the way. Each of them worth a separate blog to focus on. For example, react/rails auth system, how to serialize nested data from rails API, how to store nested data in redux, react-router, how to handle image...It's on my to-do list to blog about each of the topics later on. The topic I want to talk about is planning a project, and think in react.
It's hand down the most difficult phase/ part of the object. Now I'm toward the end of the project. I think it's a good time to refresh and reinforce this process.

Take my project HomeAway for example
When users plan for a vocation, before they book everything, they can post a listing to list their property for specific days(vocation length) during a time frame.
Others can either enter a contract to exchange property at the agreed time or rent it depends on what both parties are looking for.
Think Airbnb with exchange feature.
Step 1: what do I want to do with the app?
              Basic functionality:
              I want a user auth system.
              I want users to be able to list their houses after login.
							I want the user to view listings from others.
							Add on functionality (work in the future)
							user can message listing owner
							user can enter a contract (editable) with listing owner, and both party can edit the contract until aggreement reached.
							
Step 2: set up backend:
               What model do i need?
							 What is the relationship between models?
							 What attibutes does each model need?
							 How to save them in database?
							 
							 
step 3: think front end - what user can see and how the user can interact with the app?
	              when visiting root URL. It will show all the listings for a user to browse. Users have the option to sign in and sign up. Upon sign-in, a user profile container will be rendered and the user can manage all listings/properties inside the profile container.
								
Up until this point, I think I'm at a decent place to start coding. As a new developer, I want to develop a workflow that efficient and works for me, and gives me more confidence every time I'm working on a project/ domain. I want to have s mental map of how I should approach this project.
