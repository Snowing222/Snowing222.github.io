My interest in technology started early when I was in school, and vanished shortly after graduation when I decided to build a career in a different field. Here I am now, Twelve years after getting my diploma with a major in Computer Science, starting my software engineer boot camp journey with Flatiron School. Looking back and reflecting on my path, I really cannot help myself but thinking "NEVER SAY NEVER!"
 
Back in the days, when I was admitted to the computer science program in Beijing, I wasn’t sure: I always thought I would have studied foreign languages like French, German, and Italian in college, but there I was in the computer science department! Don't ask me how. Technology didn't appeal to me at that time, or I should say I didn’t know enough to give it a chance. I always considered myself a creative person. Arts, colors, cultures, people, places around the world…..those are the topics that fascinated me, no sitting behind a screen and dealing with a computer - Yes, that was how I pictured myself when working in IT at that time.
 
After graduation, I worked for Oracle in their Marketing department for 2 years, before I pivot and launched my career in fashion by moving to NYC and going back to school (FIT).  Years go by and as technology becomes ever more pervasive, my eyes open, my views started shifting, and now I see technology and programming under a new and interesting light. 
 
Programming is another great way of 'creating'. You can bring any idea to life and potentially reach millions of people. It requires almost nothing physical but just a brilliant mind.
 
Programming is one of the most powerful languages in the world. It's the language of the future, and the future is happening RIGHT NOW! It connects people - everybody over the world can communicate with it, no matter the mother tongue or background. What I love most about it, is that it's always spoken with a purpose. It's a language that is elegant, precise, and goal-oriented. People who master the language have become the gatekeepers of how our culture uses technology.
 
I used to think physical items are real and reliable, such as a piece of fabric, or a painting, things that can be touched and felt. Through my years of working in fashion, I realized that the fashion world is too subject… at least for me. In the fashion world there is too much I think, he thinks, she thinks …there is no such right or wrong, and what seems to be right or wrong under certain circumstances is changing all the time. Coding is different. There are rules for everyone to follow. Rules allow us to mold our interactions with computers, and define what service computers bring to us. You can create amazing things on a blank canvas with rules to follow, and when you make mistakes, the computer will give you feedback immediately. The machine is far more reliable than anyone we work with.
 
I always believe in learning and growing as my life-long journey, and life is a process to find ourselves, discover our capabilities, and pursue our passion along the way. I'm now extremely excited to embark on this new phase of my career and to see where it will lead me in the future.
